      <p>It was all a dream</p>
      <p>I used to read Word Up magazine</p>
      <p>Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine</p>
      <p>Hangin pictures on my wall</p>
      <p>Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl</p>
      <p>I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped</p>
      <p>Smoking weed and Bambu, sipping on Private Stock</p>
      <p>Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack</p>
      <p>With the hat to match</p>
      <p>Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha</p>
      <p>You never thought that hip hop would take it this far</p>
      <p>Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight</p>
      <p>Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade</p>
      <p>Born sinner, the opposite of a winner</p>
      <p>Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner</p>
      <p>Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri</p>
      <p>Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)</p>
      <p>I'm blowing up like you thought I would</p>
      <p>Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)</p>
      <p>It's all good (it's all good)</p>
      <p>And if you don't know, now you know, nigga</p>

      <p>I made the change from a common thief</p>
      <p>To up close and personal with Robin Leach</p>
      <p>And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day</p>
      <p>Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way</p>
      <p>The Moet and Aliz√© keep me pissy</p>
      <p>Girls used to diss me</p>
      <p>Now they write letters cause they miss me</p>
      <p>I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff</p>
      <p>I was too used to packing gats and stuff</p>
      <p>Now honeys play me close like butter play toast</p>
      <p>From the Mississippi down to the east coast</p>
      <p>Condos in Queens, indo for weeks</p>
      <p>Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak</p>
      <p>Living life without fear</p>
      <p>Putting 5 karats in my baby girl's ears</p>
      <p>Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool</p>
      <p>Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school</p>
      <p>Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood</p>
      <p>And it's still all good</p>
      <p>Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga</p>

      <p>Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis</p>
      <p>When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this</p>
      <p>50-inch screen, money green leather sofa</p>
      <p>Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur</p>
      <p>Phone bill about two G's flat</p>
      <p>No need to worry, my accountant handles that</p>
      <p>And my whole crew is lounging</p>
      <p>Celebrating every day, no more public housing</p>
      <p>Thinking back on my one-room shack</p>
      <p>Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back</p>
      <p>And she loves to show me off, of course</p>
      <p>Smiles every time my face is up in The Source</p>
      <p>We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us</p>
      <p>No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us</p>
      <p>Birthdays was the worst days</p>
      <p>Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay</p>
      <p>Uh, damn right I like the life I live</p>
      <p>Cause I went from negative to positive</p>
      <p>And it's all</p>
      <p>...and if you don't know, now you know, niggaaa</p>
